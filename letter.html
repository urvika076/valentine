<h1>to my sweet sweet boy</h1>

<p>
hi boyfriend,<br><br>

i pinched myself real hard today. it feels surreal. surreal to love and be loved this much. my babu u have always been the better one at this and i dont think i have near expressed how much my baby means to me.
how much your smile when u look at me as soon as we meet, even when i made u fucking wait for hours, means to me. how much your fucking adorable sexy laugh when my hilarious ass makes u laugh means to me. how much your utterly chompable face when u try to get mad at me means to me. 
how much your love for food, esp the food that i pick for u means to me. how much your love for bollywood and the cute little stories u tell me about it mean to me. how much the way u come lay on my chest like ure my baby means to me. how much u holding me tight like im yours and under ur protection mean to me.
how much u sleeping next to me skin to skin like we are one entity means to me. how much your love for old comic books means to me. how much u telling me that my voice is the last thing u want to hear before u sleep means to me. how much your little forehead kissies, ear kissies and kissies all over my face mean to me. how much your love for me means to me. and how much i love u means to me. go on, ask me how much. 

<br> to the best most talented actor ever, i lovelovelove you Ishaan
<br>love always,
<br>your hot and dumb gf,
<br>urvika <3
